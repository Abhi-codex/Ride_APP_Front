# Step-by-Step Implementation Guide for Driver System

Based on your complete backend documentation, here's the implementation roadmap for the driver system.

## üîß Backend Updates Required

### 1. Update Network Configuration
‚úÖ **DONE** - IP address updated to `192.168.96.247:3000`

### 2. Missing Driver Endpoints to Implement

Your documentation shows these endpoints, but they need to be created in your backend:

#### **Required Routes to Add:**

1. **`GET /driver/stats`** - Driver statistics
   ```javascript
   // Response format your frontend expects:
   {
     "success": true,
     "data": {
       "totalRides": 150,
       "todayRides": 5,
       "todayEarnings": 1250,
       "weeklyRides": 23,
       "weeklyEarnings": 5750,
       "monthlyEarnings": 18500,
       "rating": 4.7
     }
   }
   ```

2. **`GET /driver/profile`** - Driver profile
   ```javascript
   // Response format:
   {
     "success": true,
     "data": {
       "_id": "driver_id",
       "name": "Dr. John EMT",
       "email": "john.emt@hospital.com",
       "phone": "+1234567890",
       "role": "driver",
       "isOnline": true,
       "vehicle": {
         "type": "advancedAmbulance",
         "plateNumber": "AMB123",
         "model": "Mercedes Sprinter",
         "licenseNumber": "EMT-123456",
         "certificationLevel": "EMT-Paramedic"
       },
       "createdAt": "2021-07-21T10:30:00.000Z"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **`PUT /driver/online-status`** - Update driver availability
   ```javascript
   // Request body:
   { "isOnline": true }
   
   // Response:
   {
     "success": true,
     "message": "Driver is now online",
     "data": { "isOnline": true }
   }
   ```

### 3. Backend Implementation Steps

1. **Create `routes/driver.js`** file using the code provided in `docs/backend-driver-routes.js`

2. **Add to your main app.js**:
   ```javascript
   const driverRoutes = require('./routes/driver');
   app.use('/driver', driverRoutes);
   ```

3. **Ensure your models have required fields**:
   - **User Model**: `name`, `email`, `phone`, `role`, `isOnline`, `vehicle`
   - **Ride Model**: `driver`, `fare`, `status`, `rating`, `createdAt`

## üì± Frontend Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Driver Authentication & Profile Setup

1. **Create Driver Login Flow**
   - Phone number input
   - Role selection (driver)
   - JWT token storage

2. **Create Driver Profile Form**
   - Personal information (name, email)
   - Vehicle information (type, plate, model)
   - EMT certification details

3. **Create Profile Completion Flow**
   - Step-by-step form wizard
   - Validation for all fields
   - Profile submission

### Phase 2: Driver Dashboard Integration

1. **Real Data Integration**
   - Connect to `/driver/stats` endpoint
   - Connect to `/driver/profile` endpoint
   - Connect to `/driver/online-status` endpoint

2. **Dashboard Features**
   - Statistics display
   - Online/offline toggle
   - Profile management

### Phase 3: Driver Operations

1. **Available Rides System**
   - Connect to `/ride/driverrides` endpoint
   - Real-time ride offers
   - Accept/decline functionality

2. **Active Ride Management**
   - Status updates via `/ride/update/:rideId`
   - Real-time location tracking
   - Ride completion flow

## üîÑ Current vs Required State

### ‚úÖ **What You Already Have:**
- Authentication system (`/auth/signin`, `/auth/profile`)
- Ride management system (`/ride/*` endpoints)
- Real-time Socket.IO communication
- User model with vehicle information
- Ride model with all required fields

### ‚ùå **What You Need to Add:**
- Driver statistics aggregation (`/driver/stats`)
- Driver-specific profile endpoint (`/driver/profile`)
- Online status management (`/driver/online-status`)

## üéØ **Immediate Next Steps:**

1. **Backend**: Implement the 3 missing driver endpoints
2. **Frontend**: Create driver login and profile forms
3. **Testing**: Test the complete driver flow
4. **Integration**: Connect dashboard to real APIs

## üìù **Validation Rules for Driver Profile:**

- **Name**: Required, minimum 2 characters
- **Email**: Valid email format (optional)
- **Phone**: Required, valid phone format
- **Vehicle Type**: Must be one of: `basicAmbulance`, `advancedAmbulance`, `icuAmbulance`, `airAmbulance`
- **Plate Number**: Required, 3-15 characters
- **License Number**: Required EMT license
- **Certification**: Must be one of: `EMT-Basic`, `EMT-Intermediate`, `EMT-Paramedic`, `Critical Care`

## üîê **Security Considerations:**

- All driver endpoints require JWT authentication
- Role-based access (only drivers can access `/driver/*` endpoints)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure token storage in frontend

## üìä **Data Flow:**

```
1. Driver registers with phone + role="driver"
2. Driver completes profile with vehicle/certification info
3. Driver accesses dashboard with real statistics
4. Driver toggles online status
5. Driver receives ride offers
6. Driver accepts and manages rides
```

This guide will be updated as we implement each phase.
